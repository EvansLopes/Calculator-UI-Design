# HTML-CSS-Simples-Calculator
Simple calculator project using HTML and CSS.
To resolve the expressions it's been used the function eval(), from HTML. It consists the calculation key (plus, minus, times and divide) and calculate the results (like magic!) and it's awesome could do it right in the frontend!

I sincerely hope you enjoy and use it!

Don't be afraid to suggest any features, it's a pleasure to evolve my code!
